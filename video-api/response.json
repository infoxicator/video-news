    "aiSummary": "\n\nThe key to one of the most enduring mysteries of the last century may have died with a retired London black cab driver who was cremated in 2020. The driver was strongly believed to have been the 'great train robber' who got away with the 1963 heist, and may also have been the mystery robber known as Alf Thomas."
